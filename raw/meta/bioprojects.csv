PRJEB11419,American Gut Project,"The American Gut project is the largest crowdsourced citizen science project to date. Fecal, oral, skin, and other body site samples collected from thousands of participants represent the largest human microbiome cohort in existence. Detailed health and lifestyle and diet data associated with each sample is enabling us to deeply examine associations between the human microbiome and factors such as diet (from vegan to near carnivore and everything in between), season, amount of sleep, and disease states such as IBD, diabetes, or autism spectrum disorder-as well as many other factors not listed here. The American Gut project also encompasses the British Gut and Australian Gut projects, widening the cohort beyond North America. As the project continues to grow, we will be able to identify significant associations that would not be possible with smaller, geographically and health/disease status-limited cohorts.",2015-10-15,UCSDMI,NA
PRJEB23282,Bacterial and fungal microbiota associated with flower pollen,"Diverse microorganisms colonise the different plant-microhabitats, such as rhizosphere, and phyllosphere, and play key roles for the host. However, bacteria and fungi associated with pollen are poorly investigated, despite its ecological, commercial and medical relevance. Due to its structure and nutritive composition, pollen provides a unique microhabitat. Here, we examine the bacterial and fungal abundance, community structure, diversity and colonization pattern of pollens, using high-throughput sequencing. The pollens were collected from eight different plant species in the region of Giessen (Germany).",2019-01-11,"Research Center for Bio Systems, Land Use, and Nutrition (IFZ)",NA
PRJEB30970,Highly diverse aquatic microbial communities separated by permafrost in Greenland show distinct features according to environmental niches,"The microbial diversity of aquatic habitats above and below the permafrost layer in the Kangerlussuaq Area, Western Greenland, was studied by amplicon sequencing of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and fungal ITS1 region. The aquatic habitats included pond and lake water, glacier ice and melt water, permafrost active layer melt water and deep groundwater.",2019-03-25,VTT,NA
PRJEB31590,"Oil exposed bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in water and sediment of Baltic Sea coastal area.","Two long-term potentially oil exposed Baltic Sea coastal sites near old oil refineries and harbours were compared to nearby less exposed sites in terms of bacterial, archaeal and fungal microbiomes and oil degradation potential. The bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversities were similar in oil exposed and less exposed sampling sites based on bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene and fungal 5.8S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from both DNA and RNA fractions. The active community (based on RNA) of the coastal Baltic Sea water differed largely from the total community (based on DNA). The most noticeable this difference was in case of bacterial water samples were the active community was dominated by Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria whereas in total bacterial community Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The abundance, richness and diversity of Fungi present in water and sediment samples was in general lower than that of Bacteria and Archaea. Furthermore, the sampling location influenced the fungal community composition, whereas the bacterial and archaeal communities were not influenced. This may indicate that those fungal species that are adaptable to the Baltic Sea environments are few and that Fungi are potentially more vulnerable to or affected by the Baltic Sea conditions than Bacteria and Archaea.",2019-06-30,VTT,NA
PRJEB32265,Bacterial but not fungal gut microbiota alterations are associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) phenotype,"Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most frequent symptomatic immune disorder characterized by reduced serum immunoglobulins. Patients often suffer from infectious and serious non-infectious complications which impact their life tremendously. The monogenic cause has been revealed in a minority of patients so far, indicating the role of multiple genes and environmental factors in CVID etiology. Using 16S and ITS rRNA amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the bacterial and fungal gut microbiota, respectively, in a group of 55 participants constituting of CVID patients and matched healthy controls including 16 case-control pairs living in the same household, to explore possible associations between gut microbiota composition and disease phenotype. We revealed less diverse and significantly altered bacterial but not fungal gut microbiota in CVID patients, which additionally appeared to be associated with a more severe disease phenotype. The factor of sharing the same household impacted both bacterial and fungal microbiome data significantly, although not as strongly as CVID diagnosis in bacterial assessment. Overall, our results suggest that gut bacterial microbiota is altered in CVID patients and may be one of the missing environmental drivers contributing to some of the symptoms and disease severity. Paired samples serving as controls will provide a better resolution between disease-related dysbiosis and other environmental confounders in future studies.",2019-08-03,Centre for Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation,NA

PRJNA271113,Bacterial and fungal microbiome in children with HSCR and enterocolitis,"Development of potentially life-threatening enterocolitis is the most frequent complication in children with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), even after definitive corrective surgery. Intestinal microbiota likely contribute to the etiology of enterocolitis, so the aim of this study was to compare the fecal bacterial and fungal communities of children who developed Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) with HSCR patients who had never had enterocolitis. Eighteen Hirschsprung patients who had completed definitive surgery were enrolled: 9 had a history of HAEC and 9 did not. Fecal DNA was isolated and 16S and ITS-1 regions sequenced using Next Generation Sequencing and data analysis for species identification. The HAEC group bacterial composition showed a modest reduction in Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia with increased Bacteriodetes and Proteobacteria compared with the HD group. In contrast, the fecal fungi composition of the HAEC group showed marked reduction in diversity with increased Candida sp., and reduced Malassezia and Saccharomyces sp. compared with the HD group. The most striking finding within the HAEC group is that the Candida genus segregated into “high burden” patients with 97.8% C. albicans and 2.2% C. tropicalis compared with “low burden” patients 26.8% C. albicans and 73% C. tropicalis. Interestingly even the low burden HAEC group had altered Candida community structure with just two species compared to more diverse Candida populations in the HSCR patients. This is the first study to identify Candida sp. as potentially playing a role in HAEC either as expanded commensal species as a consequence of enterocolitis (or treatment), or possibly as pathobioants contributing to the pathogenesis of HAEC. These findings suggest a dysbiosis in the gut microbial ecosystem of HAEC patients, such that there may be dominance of fungi and bacteria predisposing patients to development of HAEC.",2014-12-23,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,human gut metagenome
PRJNA282687,Cuyahoga River multispecies Metagenome,"Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) enables identifying the presence of a species of interest in a simple and high-throughput manner. Typically, these analyses are performed by amplifying a short DNA sequence using highly specific primers. Here, we generalized this approach and characterized, by massively parallel sequencing, DNA molecules amplified using primers that are specific of a given taxon, yet provide enough information to identify the species carrying each DNA sequence. We tested this approach by analyzing 90 water samples of 40 mL collected along the Cuyahoga River. We amplified eDNA extracted from each water sample using 13 primer pairs – targeting bacteria, archaea, mammals, fish, algae, amphibians, birds, bryophytes, arthropods, copepods, diatoms, fungi and plants – and simultaneously sequenced all PCR products by high-throughput sequencing. Despite the small sample volumes, we identified DNA sequences from 14 species of fish, 17 species of mammals, 8 species of birds, 15 species of arthropods, one turtle and one salamander. Interestingly, in addition to aquatic and semi-aquatic animal species, we amplified DNA from many terrestrial species that live near the banks of the Cuyahoga River. We also identified DNA from one Asian carp species invasive to the Great Lakes but that has not been reported in the Cuyahoga River. Our study shows that analysis of eDNA extracted from small sample of water by universal amplification combined with massively parallel sequencing can provide a broad perspective on the biological diversity of a given environment.",2015-04-29,Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute,freshwater metagenome
PRJNA287840,watershed biome Raw sequence reads,"Water quality is currently assessed primarily at the tap using culture-based indicators of microbial pollution, such as coliform bacteria and E. coli. This paradigm is restrictive because it relies on century-old technologies and does not consider the broader impact of microbial pollution on the larger ecosystem. Furthermore, this approach enables only reactive responses focused on human health rather than proactive measures that protect water at its source: the watershed.</p><p>Our goal is to change the way we monitor water quality in our watersheds. Advances in genomic technology have enabled us to broadly study the microbial community composition of watersheds and to understand how this community changes in response to environmental perturbations. By broadly surveying the microbial community in our watersheds we intend to discover novel microbial indicators associated with polluted versus healthy watersheds. Our study has three principal goals:</p><p>1) To use metagenomics to measure the impact of pollution on the bacterial communities in different watersheds.</p><p>2) To use amplicon sequencing of various microbial genes including the 16S and 18S rRNA and gp23 genes to quantify the microbiome, which consist of viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotes (which include protists and fungi), of different watersheds.</p><p>3) To create novel tests that monitor these microbial community changes in order to detect pollution and pinpoint the specific source of the pollution.</p><p>By creating new tests that focus on overall watershed health, as opposed to just human health, we will provide the advanced tools needed to protect our watersheds.",2015-06-23,The University of British Columbia,freshwater metagenome

PRJNA432446,Comparison of bacteria community revealed by deep 16S rRNA pyrosequencing in two naturally suppressive or conductive soils for banana Fusarium wilt disease Raw sequence reads,"Banana Fusarium wilt disease caused by the Fusarium oxyporum f.sp.cubense race 4 fungal pathogen,has been reported to be the most limiting factor in Cavendish banana production world wise since 1996.Three field sites banana farm differing in location but have the same climate,soil type and planting time were selected to compare bacteria and fungi communities in the banana wilt diseased soils and healthy soils. In conclusion, comparisons of soil bacterial and fungi communities from fusarium wilt disease soils and Fusarium wilt suppressive (healthy) soils showed that these disease soils harbored distinctive bacterial and fungi communities,compared to healthy soils.Specifically, higher abundances of fusarium genus according with the significant FOC colonization were observed in diseased soils. Higher abundances of bacteria members within the Firmicutes phylum specifically the genera Bacillus,Lactococcus and Pseudomonas were identified in healthy soils.Meanwhile,The abundance of Ascomycota in diseased soils samples was significantly higher than in healthy soils and genera Mortierella and Trichoderma enriched in healthy soils . Moreover, the enrichment of bacillus in addition to the soil physicochemical property AP and pH were positively correlated with disease suppression.Although it is difficult to understand the exact mechanisms for enhanced disease suppression driven by the composition of the microbial community or by specific populations. Our study reveals that banana Fusarium wilt suppressive soils(healthy soils) has unique bacteria and fungi composition and we identified specific genus population that may be considered useful for consrtructing healthy soil microganism structure. Although it is difficult to describe the proportion of every genus in healthy banana farm soil or in diseased banana farm soil.This study reveals that there may be some disciplinarian of specific genus population proportion between healthy soils and diseased soils.specifically there may be a kind of balance between the pathogen and benenifical genus in healthy soil,if we obtain the balance point or range,then use theory of traditional Chinese Medicine to construct the balance will play a positive role in controlling Fusarium wilt disease.",2018-01-31,China Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences,uncultured prokaryote

PRJNA496065,Differential regulation of the response to radiation therapy by commensal bacteria and fungi,"The intestinal microbiome, typically equated with bacteria, influences the response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy in multiple cancer types. Here, we show that intestinal commensal fungi regulate the anti-tumor immune response following radiation and that fungi have an inverse relationship with bacteria in governing the response of tumors to radiation. Mice lacking commensal fungi show enhanced responsiveness to radiation, whereas mice without commensal bacteria exhibited reduced responses with associated overgrowth of commensal fungi. Mice devoid of intestinal fungi had increased intratumoral cytotoxic T cells and a reduction in suppressive T cells and macrophages. Thus, optimal responses to cancer therapies depend on the previously unrecognized commensal fungal population that mediates its effects by modulating the immunosuppressive functions of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.",2018-10-12,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,gut metagenome

PRJNA526458,Soil water stress history wheat microbiome,"Even though some plant-associated microbes are known to help plants to cope with water stress, there is little understanding about how soil water stress history and host genotype influence the response of wheat-associated microbiome under short-term decreases in soil moisture. To address this, we investigated how plant breeding history (four wheat genotypes; two with recognized drought resistance and two without) and soil water stress history (same wheat field soil from Saskatchewan with contrasting long-term irrigation) independently or interactively influenced the response of the rhizosphere, root and leaf bacterial and fungal microbiota to short-term decreases in soil moisture. We combined amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA gene for bacteria and ITS region for fungi) with real-time PCR (qPCR) to quantitatively characterize the wheat microbiome. Fungal and bacterial communities responses to short-term decreases in soil water content were mainly constrained by soil water stress history, with some smaller, but significant influence of plant genotype. One exception was the leaf-associated fungal communities, for which the largest constraint was genotype, resulting in a clear differentiation of the communities based on the genotype’s sensitivity to water stress. Interpreting the data based on relative or estimated absolute abundances revealed substantial discrepancies, suggesting that important shifts might be missed using compositional data derived from amplicon sequencing. Overall, the results from this study highlight that both plant and soil histories need to be taken into consideration when trying to understand the response of plant-associated microbiome to short-term decreases in soil moisture.",2019-03-11,National Research Council Canada,soil metagenome

PRJNA606949,A study of soil texture effects on microbiome: HTS of 16S rRNA genes and ITS regions,"Soil texture is an essential component of soil survey for estimating potentials and limitations of land use and management. It has been appreciated as an important predictor for numerous soil processes. However, its connections with the diversity and composition of the soil microbial community remain less understood. This work employed a marker gene high-throughput sequencing approach to determine soil texture-based patterns of bacterial and fungal distribution. Thirty-six intact soil cores were sampled from bermudagrass ecosystems across seven soil texture classes with sand fraction varying from 30.3 to 83.4 percent and clay fraction from 4.4 to 53.0 percent. These soil cores were arranged into three sets of equal numbers, and each set of 12 was subjected to three moisture regimes (dry spell, field moisture, and saturation-field capacity), respectively, for 15 days. Soil cores were further stratified into top and bottom sections, leading to a total of 72 samples with varying soil physical and chemical properties. Our data revealed that fungal alpha diversity was more strongly related to soil texture than the bacterial one, with fungal species richness and Shannon diversity being positively correlated with the sand fraction. Soil texture was the second most important factor after soil pH in shaping the soil microbial community. Relative abundances of some fungi (Basidiomycota and Eurotiomycetes) and filamentous bacteria (Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi) significantly increased with silt and/or clay content. The genetic potential for the degradation of organic compounds also appeared to be higher in finer textured soils than the coarse-textured soils. By identifying sand, silt or clay-preferred microbial taxa and characterizing mineral particle-dependent genetic potential of organic carbon degradation and nitrogen cycling, this work highlighted the significance of soil texture and further discussed texture-associated pores and resource locality in regulating microbial diversity and composition.",2020-02-16,North Carolina State University,NA
