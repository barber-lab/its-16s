#' Calculate keystoneness
#'
#' Keystone taxa have a high mean degree and closeness but low betweeness centrality (Nat Rev Microbiol 16, 567â€“576 (2018))
#' Furthermore, they are very prevalent. This method treats all properties with equal weight and calculates a keystoness in range of 0 to 1
#' @param graph coabundance tibble graph
#' @param prevalences tibble with columns taxon and prevalence_perc
#' @return tibble graph with node columns including keystoneness attached
